/**
 * A note about synchronization of counter state: the counter API in spark was originally designed to not
 * require thread safety by merging changes only linearly on the executor after each RDD action.
 *
 * However... it seems like there was an oversight in the design because there have been reported crashes
 * where thread safety is required. Look at the following for reference:
 * https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17463, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15371, and
 * https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15063
 *
 * Out of abundance of caution until this patch is no longer required, we are following the example pattern
 * for implementations such as CollectionAccumulator:
 * https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87c744b60507f82e1722f1488f1741cb2bb8e8e5/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/AccumulatorV2.scala#L472
 *
 * In that example, all operations (add, value, copy, and merge) are synchronized across threads
